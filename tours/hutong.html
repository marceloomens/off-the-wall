    	<p>Beijing is famous for its hutongs. The narrow long alleys located around the Forbidden City within the ancient City Walls are still one of the most popular places to visit. Many hutongs have already been torn down and replaced by modern apartment buildings. Some are being restored in ancient architectural style and some remained the same. During this tour we will wander through some ancient hutongs where you will be surprised by the tranquil atmosphere. No rush, no noisy cars and no high-risers; you will totally forget the fact that we are in the Capital of the second World Economy. In these local streets barbers cut men’s hair; groups of old men gather to play Mah-jong or Chinese chess. We will discover the local trades in the small alleys and try some local treats. We cannot go past the more popular sites like the Lama Temple, Confucius Temple and Drum- and Bell tower. We will visit Houhai Lake where the serene tranquillity in the middle of the city Centre will take you by surprise. Depending on your wishes we will end in Nan Luo Gu Xiang, one of the most famous streets downtown for its boutiques, food stalls and many restaurant. It is a perfect place to end and to sit down in one of the nice local restaurants for a cup of coffee or tea, a beer or lunch.</p>
        <p>The tour is around 2-3 hours. Since we will be on foot, we have the flexibility to decide where to start and where to end at your convenience.</p>
