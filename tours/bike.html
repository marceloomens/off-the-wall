    <p>It is a great tour that takes you around the Forbidden City and Tianenman square where you can experience the power of communism when crossing these big roads and the enormous buildings in this spacious area. Then via hutongs, these are small streets where the Chinese already live for centuries in courtyards, we will cruise along Houhai lake. This is such a pleasant serene place in the heart of the city where the Chinese go to relax and to share snacks with their family. We will take a short rest to enjoy the view and I will treat you to a local drink.</p>
    <p>To find out more about the Beijing street life I will take you to a local area where not many tourists go (it is not in the books). It is a vibrant area where many kinds of trade take place, like: season fruits and vegetables; local snacks; a dentist selling second handed braces (!); street barbers; migrants selling themselves as carpenters etc. I will also take you, if you like, to a wet market. The people here are so friendly and are always willing to let you try their delicious fruits or smell their different tea flavours.</p>
    <p>I will explain why the Chinese built their hutongs from East to West; why the view into a courtyard house is always blocked; why every courtyard has 2 stones in front of the entrance and why you can only find hutongs in Beijing. Todays life in the hutongs is similar to the life of hundreds years ago when China was still an empire. Of course you need some background info about Chinese history and it is up to you how much I share with you.</p>
    <p>The tour takes around 2,5 to 3 hours and best moment of the day is in the morning to visit the fresh market.</p>
