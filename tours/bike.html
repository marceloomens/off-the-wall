        <p>This is a great tour that takes you around the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square where you can experience the power of communism when crossing big roads and enormous buildings in this spacious area. We continue via hutongs, small streets where the Chinese have lived for centuries in courtyards, we will cruise along Houhai lake, such a pleasant serene place in the heart of the city where the Chinese go to relax and share snacks with their family. We will take a short rest to enjoy the view and I will treat you to a local drink.</p>
        <p>After that it is back to the hustle and bustle of street life. During this tour I will bring you to a local area shy of tourists. The place is vibrant with many kinds of trade. Find local fruits and vegetables, typical snacks, migrants selling themselves as carpenters, street barbers and the odd dentist selling second-hand braces. There is also a wet market we can visit. Sellers are friendly and always in for letting you taste their delicious fruit or smell all the tea flavours.</p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered why the Chinese built their hutongs from East to West?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Why the view into a courtyard house is always blocked?</li>
            <li>Why every courtyard has 2 stones in front of the entrance?</li>
            <li>Why you can only find hutongs in Beijing?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Find out about this and more during this tour. Todayâ€™s life in the hutongs is similar to the life of hundreds of years ago when China was still an empire. Some background info about Chinese history is a must.</p>
        <p>The tour takes around 2,5 to 3 hours and the morning is most favorable to visit the fresh market. We will start and end the tour close to the Forbidden City from where you can easily move on.</p>
