        <p>Come and join me for a tour to Beijing’s edgy, fascinating contemporary art scene. It is an inspiring neighborhood of communist-era factories and warehouses, nowadays used as art galleries, boutiques, coffee shops and restaurants.</p>
        <p>Once listed to be torn down, it has now become the exhibition center of Chinese culture and art. The unique architectural Bauhaus-style gives the area a distinguished ambiance of art nouveau in China with a European touch. No wonder that many artists use this area as background for their artwork. Nowadays it frequently holds important international art exhibitions and art activities as well as fashion shows.</p>
        <p>Let’s get carried away by this tour while visiting some prevalent galleries and browsing through the inspiring nouveau riche alleys of this previous factory plant. If you have time left it is a great area to have a drink on one of the tempting terraces or have a meal in one of the plenty nice restaurants.</p>
        <p>This tour takes around 2 hours and is perfect in the afternoon after a visit to one of the historical sites downtown. Keep in mind that most galleries open daily at 10am. On Monday many galleries are closed. The area is around 30 minutes away from the Forbidden City.</p>
