    <p>This tour will take you away from down town Beijing of ancient history and culture and give you some insight in Urbanisation in China. In one of the outskirts of Beijing is a small village Fei li chum where many migrants from the rural areas settled down and created their own self-sufficient community. Just outside the expensive compounds with luxurious villas and the big International schools you find this village where many live to serve the wealthy life style of the rich and make a living as taxi drivers; ayi's (helps) or cashiers of the high end supermarkets. It is a nice area where we can find many restaurants, wet markets, salons, barbershops, repair shops, laundry services, tailors, bakeries, school, fruit orchards, garbage dump and even a red light district.</p>
    <p>The tour takes around 2 hours and can be done any time of the day. Fei Li Chun is located close to the Airport, which makes it a perfect place to combine on your way to the airport. From Chaoyang District (the Village in Sanlitun) it is around a 30 minutesâ€™ drive. It is not far located from 798, which makes it easy to combine both tours on one day.</p>
