    <p>This tour will take you away from down town city of ancient history and culture and give you some insight on Urbanisation in China. In one of the outskirts of Beijing is a small village Fei li chun where many migrants from the rural area’s, settled down and created their own self-sufficient community. Just outside the expensive compounds with luxurious villa’s and the big International schools you find this village where many live to serve the wealthy life of the rich and make a living as taxi drivers; ayi’s (help) or cashiers of the high end supermarkets. It is a nice area where we can find many restaurants, wet market, salons, barbershops, repair shops, laundry service, tailors, bakeries, school, fruit orchards, garbage dump and even a red light district.</p>
