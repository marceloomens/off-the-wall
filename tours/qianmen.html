    	<p>Come and join me on a walk trough the hustle and bustle of Qianmen, once the busiest sections of town. The area is situated just outside the ancient City Walls, close to the main gate, linking the Inner City with the Outer city.  In this area the grid pattern deviate of most of Beijing hutongs and it is famous for the shopping and entertainment that developed during Qing Dynasty. Many merchants and visitors from the province stopped here on their way to the Inner City. Officials who were too low in rank to live in the Inner city, moved in the courtyards in Qianmen. Scholars preparing their empire exam resided resulting in all kinds of art supplies on offer. Unlike the inner city some earthly delights were allowed and the brothels and opium dens were so well-known that high officials and the nobles (even some Emperors) came here for their pleasure.</p>
        <p>On this tour I will take you to the flourishing business street Qianmen Dajie where we will be looking for a centuries old shop for braised mutton who even served Cixi during the old days.  We will visit the narrowest hutong in Beijing with its quite unusual history. Then we will walk into a famous shopping street of old Beijng, now called Dashilan. There, we will see some shops with hundreds of years of history: some names are read from right to left or are written in traditional Chinese characters. We will see what local Beijing pickles look like, but also Chinese products like cloth shoes, silk and traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese tea.  An old theater on the street is still functioning. The first Chinese cinema established in this street.</p>
        <p>Then I will take you away from this bustling shopping street and we will stroll through the Bada hutongs where we will see the so-called tea houses, used as brothels. Then we will cruise to Liulichang. This street is named for the kilns that produced the glazed tiles for the Temple of Heaven and Palace roof during the Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties. Here we will find many shops catering the scholars, selling paintings, antiques, books, brushes, ink, chops and rice paper. Some are still open today.</p>
        <p>Join me on this great tour in old Beijing and get your selfie in the narrowest hutong of Beijing!</p>
