    		<p>My name is <a href="#">Mirella Coolen</a> and I am a Beijing tour guide.</p>
    		<p>On <a href="#">my tours</a> you will discover the contrast between the richness of Chinese history and the modern China. Explore how East met West by strolling through the ancient hutongs downtown or by cruising the lakes in the heart of the city. Get overwhelmed by communist architecture, experience imperial power, learn how deeply Feng Shui is embedded in the heart of the Chinese people.</p>
            <p>I aim to visit the hidden places that are not standard. You are most welcome on one of my group tours. <a href="#">Check the calendar</a>, or <a href="#">email me</a> to book a private tour.</p>
            <p>I look forward to meeting you somewhere in Beijing.</p>
            <p>Mirella</p>
