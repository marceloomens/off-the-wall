		<h1>About</h1>
	</div>
    <p>My name is Mirella Coolen and I am from the Netherlands. I have lived in Beijing with my family for a couple of years now. We have 3 young children between the ages of 9 to 13 and we are all thankful that we have the opportunity to live in this interesting city. Though Beijing, with its 20 million inhabitants, is the Capital of China, it has not the cosmopolitan importance like Shanghai has. Beijing has so much history and culture on offer, which makes this place never boring. The beautiful green parks, ancient and modern architecture, Feng Shui nestled in the hearts of the people, Chinese art, temples, imperial buildings, are all a great inspiration for me. Let it be the main reason why I became a tour guide. It is a true pleasure to show visitors the other side of Chinese people, to let you experience the constant presence of history in daily life and see through Beijing dust characteristic features of this city.</p>
    <p>I am open to any suggestions or spontaneously chosen de-tours. There is never a dull moment in China and that counts for my tours as well. Of course you will see the highlights of Beijing during one of the tours but I prefer to add some rare and hidden places nowhere to be found in a standard top 10. That is why we call the tours “Off the Wall”. I would like to treat you, just like I once was, to the street scene of a dentist with all of his equipment, second-hand braces and teeth on display taking care of his patient as a true professional.</p>
    <p>Private tours cater for up to 10 persons from Monday to Friday between 9am and 4pm. Another possibility is group tours, which can be found on the home page by clicking “calendar”. Reserve your spot on a group tour by emailing me.</p>
    <p><small>Disclaimer: Assuming there are no health issues that could conflict with joining a tour, all tours are on the participant’s own risk.</small></p>
    <h2>Group tours</h2>
    <p>You can find the schedule of the group tours on the home page of this website. Each tour has a maximum number of participants. Availability is on a first come first serve basis. For more information or registration please email. A confirmation email will be sent out after registration.</p>
    <h2>On foot</h2>
    <p>Walking tours are more tailor-made. There is room for interaction and specific information. We can focus on the details that interest you and there might even be time for local treats, souvenirs or a drink, all according to your requests.</p>
    <h2>By bike</h2>
    <p>Beijing by bike is another story. Beijing is totally flat, so no steep hills to take. While biking we can enjoy longer distances and pass by a lot more famous sites. There will be time for stops in between to get some background information or to take a closer look at the view. These are also opportunities for questions. Participants, who wish to book a bike tour, should be confident on a bike as Beijing traffic can be chaotic and the streets busy. It is not dangerous; the traffic rules and regulations are similar to Western rules; there are traffic lights at intersections but you always need to be aware of the people around you.</p>
    <h2>Safety</h2>
    <p>Traffic in Beijing is similar to traffic in any other major city. To guarantee our safety we need to look after ourselves on foot and by bike. This means that we need to respect the rules; participate pro-actively with patience in traffic and move on with awareness of the vehicles or pedestrians around us. Helmets can be provided, if requested. Participation is at your own risk.</p>
    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>Children from 12 years and older are welcome to all of the tours. For younger children we could better discuss the options. Additional children seats; tandems or children’s trailer can be rented.</p>
