		<h1>About</h1>
	</div>

    <p>My name is Mirella Coolen and I am from the Netherlands. I live in Beijing with my family for a couple of years. We have 3 young children in the age of 9 to 13 and we are all thankful that we have the opportunity to live in this interesting city. Though Beijing is the Capital city of China and with its 20 million inhabitants it has not the cosmopolitan importance, like Shanghai has. Beijing has so much history and culture to show which makes the city never boring to me. The beautiful green parks, ancient and modern architecture, Feng Shui, Chinese art, temples, imperial buildings are a great inspiration for me which is why I started to be a tour guide. I am very much enjoying to take people around to show a different side of the Chinese people; to let people experience the presence of history in daily life; and to let people see through Beijing dust to discover the characteristic features of Beijing.</p>
    <p>I like to share my experiences and my knowledge with visitors of Beijing. I am open to any suggestions or spontaneous detours. There is never a dull moment in China and that counts for my tours as well. My most eye-catching experience is that a dentist, with on his foldable table his equipment and some second-hand braces and teeth, was threatening a patient in the street.</p>
    <p>My tours take about 2 to 3 hours depending several factors like the size of a group or the pace that we need etc. I do private tours from 1 up to 10 persons from Monday to Friday between 9am-4pm.  I also organise group tours for which you can subscribe by emailing me. The group tours can be found <a href="#footer-widgets">on the homepage under calendar</a>. By booking a tour with me I assume that there are no health issues that can be of any risk during the tour. The tours are on your own risk.</p>

    <h5>On foot</h5>
    <p>During these tours there is more opportunity to have more interaction with each other and you might get more information. There is more focus on the details and we might even try some local treats or buy local souvenirs. If requested we will stop somewhere for a drink.</p>

    <h5>By bike</h5>
    <p>Beijing by bike is something different. Beijing is totally flat so no steep hills to take. We can do a longer distance when walking therefore we will see more interesting sites. There is less opportunity for interaction. Still I will stop at certain places for explanation and you can ask your questions while enjoying  the view. You need to be confident on a bike as Beijing traffic can be chaotic and the streets can be busy. It is not dangerous; the traffic rules are similar to Western rules; there are traffic lights at intersections but you always need to be aware of the people around you. We use our bell a lot for safety reasons.</p>

    <h5>Safety</h5>
    <p>Traffic in Beijing is similar than what we are used to. To guarantee our safety we need to look after ourselves on foot and by bike. This means that we need to respect the rules; participate pro-actively with patience in traffic and moving on with awareness of the vehicles or pedestrians around us. Helmets can be provided, if requested. You participate in my tours at your own risk.</p>

    <h5>Children</h5>
    <p>Children from 12 years and older are welcome to all of my tours. For younger children it is better we discuss the options. I can rent additional children seats; tandems or childrens trailor.</p>
